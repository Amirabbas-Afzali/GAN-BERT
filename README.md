# GAN-BERT
### The final project of Deep Learning course , 4/2024, Sharif University of Technology

In this project, we have implemented a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for text classification in Semi-Supervised mode. Our proposed network is based on the GAN-BERT model introduced in the paper **GAN-BERT: Generative Adversarial Learning for Robust Text Classification with a Bunch of Labeled Examples, 2020** , with modifications to the Discriminator and Generator architecture as well as the loss function. Our results were obtained using the SemiVal Dataset. 

Additionally, it is worth noting that at the end of our project, we observed that the distribution of the training and validation datasets (obtained from "subtaskB_train.jsonl") differed significantly from that of the test dataset (obtained from "subtaskB_dev.jsonl").
